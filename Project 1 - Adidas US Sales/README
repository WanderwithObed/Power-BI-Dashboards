##  Project Overview
An interactive Power BI dashboard showcasing **Adidas US sales** in 2020–2021.  
Track key metrics such as Total Sales, Units Sold, Average Price, Operating Profit, sales trends, performance by states and retailers, and sales method distribution.


##  Data Sources
- Raw sales data: CSV or Excel (Orders, Dates, Regions, Retailers)  
- Supplementary lookup tables (state to region mapping, etc.)  


##  Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop for visualization & modeling  
- Power Query for data cleaning  
- DAX for measures (e.g., Total Sales, Average Price, Profit)  
- GitHub for version control and collaboration


##  Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Data import and type conversion  
- Handling missing values and removing duplicates  
- Creating calculated columns (e.g., Month Short Name, Region mapping)  
- Establishing proper table relationships


##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Trend analysis via line/area charts (monthly sales patterns)  
- Geospatial analysis (state-level sales heatmap)  
- Retailer ranking (bar chart of sales by retailer)  
- Sales method breakdown (pie/donut chart)


##  Data Analysis & Modeling
- DAX measures:  
  - TotalSales = SUM(Orders[Sales])  
  - AvgPrice = DIVIDE(TotalSales, SUM(Orders[Units Sold]))  
  - OperatingProfit = SUM(Orders[Profit])  
- Slicers/filters for Year, Region, Product category


##  Results & Findings
- 2021 showed significant sales growth compared to 2020  
- Leading retailers: West Gear ($242.9M), Foot Locker ($220M), Sports Direct ($182.5M)  
- In-store, outlet, and online sales distribution  
- Regional sales patterns revealed by US state map


##  Recommendations
- Leverage high-performing retailers for partnership expansions  
- Ramp up online channel investment due to growing volume share  
- Explore marketing in underperforming states identified by the heatmap


##  Limitations
- Data covers only two years (2020–2021)  
- No demographic or customer-level insights  
- Possible data granularity issues (e.g., missing state-level details)

- Project visuals and methodology references (e.g., Power BI documentation)
